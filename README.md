# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
This project involves some of the important topics such as Probability,Regression and some statistical methods with the help of numpy,pandas and other libraries of Python 

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
